<div class="intro">
    Ah, Weekend! That very word sounds like a spell, a spell as strong as Expecto Patronum that chases all depressing thoughts away from you. College students, professionals, freelancers, entrepreneurs or stay-at-home parents, everyone deserves a smashing Weekend. If you have had a rough week, you need to make just one decision this Weekend – bottle or glass? So, shut down your laptops, put on your jackets and head straight to the best and happening pubs in your city.

<h1 >1. Swig, Pune</h1>

<p > One of the most popular and chic resto-bars in the city, Swig will sweep you off your feet the moment you enter. With bare brick walls, outdoor seating areas, live sports screening, a foosball table and a vintage telephone booth, the place scores high on ambiance and interior décor. If you are looking to grab an after-work drink with your friends or watch your favorite football match all by yourself, this is indeed a great choice. Gastronomes might not find the food menu here very extensive or diverse. However, what it lacks in diversity, it makes up for in quality and class. Keep in mind that all brewing and mixing at Swig stops just before midnight, so if you want to keep the night going, it’s better to include one more pub in your Friday plan. And the best part? The place is pet-friendly and you don’t have to leave your furry friend back at home when you go partying.</p>

<h1>2.1000 OAKS, Pune</h1>

<p>If you are a Punekar in your twenties, 1000 Oaks needs no introduction; it is probably where you had your first drink. For those who are new to the city, here’s everything you should know about the place. More popularly known as T-Oaks, this is an extremely popular pub in Pune with a bar, restaurant, and an open garden area. It was once a bungalow and later converted into what it is today – a resto-bar. When it comes to décor and music, classic is the word that defined T-Oaks. And if you want to feel nostalgic listening to iconic retro music (yeah, hits of Bryan Adams included!), come to this place. The North Indian food served here will not disappoint you. Don’t forget to order their Barman’s Pitcher, which is and has always been the crowd favorite.

<p>Looking for pubs in Pune with dance floors where you can dance to your heart’s content all through the night and up until the dawn? Off you to go to Mi-a-Mi, the city’s most famous nightclub spread over a whopping area of 15,000 square feet. Housed within JW Marriot, the place has everything you would expect from a nightclub – luxurious couches with silk upholstery, neon lights, a stage area for artists to perform, and plush interiors.  The club is open only three days of the week and you are required to follow a casual dress code. Also remember, Mi-a-Mi is not among the pubs in Pune with free entry. It comes with a hefty entry fee for couples as well as stags, but the experience, drinks, and food are totally worth it.
