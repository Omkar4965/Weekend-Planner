<p >Sarasbaug is a major landmark in the city of Pune in India.[1] The place where the park now stands was once occupied by a small lake. However, the lake dried up and was later developed into Sarasbaug. The whole 25-acre (10 ha) complex is known as Sarasbaug. The Ganesh temple in Saras Baug is also known as Talyatla Ganapati (in Marathi:तळ्यातला गणपती ) which translates as the Ganapati of the lake.</p>

<p>Butterfly gardening is a way to create, improve, and maintain habitat for lepidopterans including butterflies, skippers, and moths.Butterflies have four distinct life stages—egg, larva, chrysalis, and adult. In order to support and sustain butterfly populations, an ideal butterfly garden contains habitat for each life stage.
Butterfly larvae, with some exceptions such as the carnivorous harvester (Feniseca tarquinius), consume plant matter and can be generalists or specialists. While butterflies like the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) are known to consume over 200 plants as caterpillars, other species like the monarch (Danaus plexippus),and the regal fritillary (Speyeria idalia) only consume plants in one genus, milkweed and violets, respectively.
