<p>The Empress Botanical Garden is named after Queen Victoria back when she held the sceptre. Once a favourite among the British officials and thus also named Soldier's Garden, the place is now a sprawling greenery of 39 acres with hundreds of rare species in trees and flowers. Empress Garden makes for a great place to take a stroll in the afternoon, learn about our flora in the flower exhibitions and breathe in some fresh air away from the city traffic.

The garden sustains a number of plants and flowers of rare origin and is home to various indigenous varieties that are more than a hundred years old. Spanning around 59 acres, the empress garden is regarded as a botanical park where one can go for a casual stroll and gain knowledge about different species of trees, shrubs, vines and blooming beauties. The garden is a result of the labour of love as the experts spend a good amount of time and invest considerable effort and diligence in the upkeep of this botanical park. </p>

<p>The variety of trees and biodiversity in this garden is amazing. You get to see ayurvedic plants like hirda, behada, arjuna, reetha apart from familiar jamun, ilmli, sitafal, drum stick, curry leaves plants. What makes this place extra special, is the involvement/struggle of neighboring community in preserving these trees over number of years.
    Accessibility is little tricky and occasional odour is part of experience.
