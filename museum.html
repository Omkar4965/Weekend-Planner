<p > Just like people collect books, Raja Dinkar Kelkar had a penchant for artifacts and knick-knacks. This led him to collect approximately 20,000 articles ranging from furniture, vessels, and hookahs to puppet jewelry of the rarest kind. Dedicated to his son, the museum today also constitutes the Mastani Mahal and the famous Institute of Musicology and fine arts.
On a fine day, if you take a stroll along the displays of the Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum Pune, you will find utensils dating back to the 18th and 19th century. Do stop and check for the intricate detailing on these rare finds made of copper, brass, and terracotta.</p>

<p>Located in the cantonment area of Indian Army, the National War Museum was opened in the year 1998. One of the best museums in Pune, the fact that it is built and maintained by funds raised by the public makes it one unique place to visit in Pune.
 Dedicated to the brave martyrs who laid down their lives for the freedom of our country, the National War Museum simply gives you goosebumps. The gloomy story behind the fight of each soldier can be found here. The stone plaques rising to 8 feet have a total of 1200 names inscribed on them.
However, the major attraction of this must-visit museum has to be the MIG 23 BN Jet Fighter which was used in the Kargil war.
