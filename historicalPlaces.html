<p>If you ask any resident of this city to list the historical places in Pune district, Aga Khan Palace is sure to appear among the top names, and for a good reason. The palace is a testament to glorious architecture and will offer you a stunning visual treat. Built in the 19th century, the spectacular palace stands on sprawling lawns and boasts of five halls. Huge hallways and Italian arches feature throughout the structure. Apart from its structural beauty, there’s one more reason that firmly establishes this palace’s position among the historical places of Pune. The palace was used as a prison to lock up Mahatma Gandhi and other patriotic leaders during the country’s freedom struggle. Today, it serves as the headquarters of the Gandhi National Memorial Society.

<h1>4. Lal Mahal, Pune</h1>

<div class="info" >
<p>Lal Mahal is one of the landmark monuments of Pune, constructed by Shahaji Bhosale, the father of Shivaji, for his wife and son. The original structure was built in 1630, but after its destruction, it was rebuilt in 1988. The place holds much historical significance as Shivaji had spent almost a decade of his childhood here. Made of red bricks, this beautiful edifice exudes a matchless charm that has turned it into a tourist hotspot in Pune.
