<div class="info"  >
<p>The Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park is named after Queen Victoria back when she held the sceptre. Once a favourite among the British officials and thus also named Soldier's Garden, the place is now a sprawling greenery of 39 acres with hundreds of rare species in trees and flowers. Empress Garden makes for a great place to take a stroll in the afternoon, learn about our flora in the flower exhibitions and breathe in some fresh air away from the city traffic.

The garden sustains a number of plants and flowers of rare origin and is home to various indigenous varieties that are more than a hundred years old. Spanning around 59 acres, the empress garden is regarded as a botanical park where one can go for a casual stroll and gain knowledge about different species of trees, shrubs, vines and blooming beauties. The garden is a result of the labour of love as the experts spend a good amount of time and invest considerable effort and diligence in the upkeep of this botanical park. </p>
